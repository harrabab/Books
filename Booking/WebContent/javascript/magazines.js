        description: `September 16 was a big day (*ahem* night) for late-night TV. No, Jimmy Fallon wasn’t finally told to stop talking over his guests, and, no, Jimmy Kimmel didn’t send Guillermo to another red carpet. Instead, we were introduced to the new superwoman of late-night TV: comedian Lilly Singh.
            The Toronto-born YouTuber was already making waves before the debut of her show, A Little Late With Lilly Singh, and is now making history as only the second woman to host a late-night show on a network (shout-out to Joan Rivers!) and the first woman of colour to do so. Which, in a world of navy-suited white men named Jimmy, is a pretty big freakin’ deal. And, TBQH, the first episode was entirely worth the 1:35am wake-up call.<br /><br />
            From the start of Singh’s premiere episode, the comedian made it *very* clear that her foray into late-night is going to be like no other, kicking off the show with a hilarious monologue that shaded the very distinct lack of shade in the late-night sphere and made references to her background as a South Asian LGBTQ woman. And IT. WAS. THRILLING!! To hear someone who looks like me make references and use terms that actually resonate with my own experience and upbringing was so exciting.
            When Singh lamented about the nonsensicality of “chai tea,” I felt that. <br /><br /> When she opened her monologue by predicting the thoughts of most Middle American viewers—”Why are they playing Slumdog Millionaire after Seth Meyers?”—I LOL’d, hard. And when she talked with uber-didi Mindy Kaling about being mistaken for Priyanka Chopra and Hasan Minhaj (i.e., the only other visible South Asian celebrities in Hollywood), I could 100% relate.
            No, no one has ever mistaken *me* for Chopra, but they have mistaken me for one of the handful of other South Asian women in the room.`,

        title: `This Canadian Plus-Size Model Launched a Clothing Line and We're Obsessed`,
        imageUrl: "https://www.flare.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/INLINE-4.jpg",
        description: `When Lauren Chan announced that she was working on a line of plus-size workwear, I was immediately excited. Chan is a Canadian model, now based in New York, and the former fashion editor at Glamour. She always rocks the most devastatingly chic looks, so I knew that if anyone could get this right, it’s her.
            True enough, she started with the right approach. Rather than assuming what her customers would want, over the last six months she polled her Instagram followers about their preferences (stretch vs no stretch, solid colours vs prints). The result is exactly what the market has been missing: a collection of 12 stunning work-to-party pieces available in sizes 12 through 24. (Seriously, these pieces are so chic that Henning was written up in Vogue on its official launch day last week.)<br /><br />
            And the contruction and detail is just as impressive: think reinforced inner-thigh seams, anti-gaping buttons and hidden elastic waistbands. For Chan, the response so far has been nothing short of overwhelming. I spoke with her after her wildly successful launch week about her favourite pieces from the line, how she plans to grow her business and why “dressing for your body” is total BS.
            Working in fashion, I had never been able to wear anything that was on par with any of my colleagues. And with the clothing I did have available to me, there were some specific incidents that are scarred into my memory. When I was on my way to my first cover interview (which is the biggest test you can have as a journalist at a magazine), my pants split up the butt while I was getting into my Uber. I had to do the interview with my bare butt on the chair. So, I always felt like I didn’t quite belong.
            <br /><br />
            I wanted a power suit or two, a knockout dress to wear to after-work events and I really wanted a high-quality coat. I used to buy designer bags so that I could make myself look more put together; I would have liked to have had a coat like this to take my look up a notch.
            One thing that surprised me in our focus groups was that at a luxury price point, people said that they preferred basic colours over things with patterns. I was toying with making more things in black and navy, and I’m really glad that we added the brown pants and the green dress and the baby blue suit, because those are things that people are really excited about. And fuck the trope that plus-size people have to wear only black. That’s not a message that I wanted to put out into the world.`,

        title: `Peter Weber Is the Next Bachelor and I Am Losing It`,
        description: `After a tumultuous season of The Bachelorette that included highlights such as: Hannah Brown choosing men that already have girlfriends; Luke P. in general; Tyler C. dating Gigi Hadid; and the sheer insult of sending home the perfection that is Mike Johnson—ABC has *actually* shocked me. Announced during the Bachelor in Paradise finale, Peter Weber—the 28-year-old pilot from Westlake Village, California, and overall snore-fes—is our next Bachelor and my brain cannot deal. I do not possess
             the mental dexterity to wrap my mind around this blatantly disrespectful decision. Someone get Chris Harrison on the line—who gave him permission?! TBH, I half expected Ashton Kutcher to jump out from behind a van and tell us we, as a society, have been Punk’d. But then I remembered it’s not 2003. And confusion set in. Mike Johnson is out here being the literal hunk of the century and we are choosing yet another VERY regular pilot?? Mike is style and grace. He is a respectful angel dropped from the heavens
              into the Bach Nation empire. <br /><br />And to put it plainly, I would not be able to spot Weber in a crowded Chipotle and that is the truest definition of a viable Bachelor candidate, if I’m being perfectly honest. Pilot Pete is a *light* Ben Higgins but with the ability to speak Spanish (like a lot of America) and fly a plane (not like most of America). Do those skills absolve him from beating out loving, cute, attractive, hilarious and diverse Big Mike? Absolutely not, but here’s the tea on our next Bachelor, if you care.
              After Hannah confessed on national television that she and Pistol Pilot Pete had mile-high action four times over within the confines of a windmill during their overnight fantasy suite date, that infamous performance might be his greatest pull to get Sugar Bear Hair endorsing hopefuls auditioning for a chance for round two.Per his nickname, Pete is exactly that, a pilot for Delta Airlines, and aviation runs in the family. Both his dad and doppelgänger brother Jack are pilots as well. Which means he’s worldly like
              Carmen Sandiego and if ABC is committed to this storyline I expect a plane ride in every date. The 28-year-old’s hometown date with Hannah Banana was wholesome AF and we got a peek into his very sweet and normal family dynamic. The Cuban-German household sat down to break bread and took part in a v. cool, pre-dinner German prayer which included chants and high fives.`,

        timeStamp: "11/03/2004",
        description: `“That is not how we do things in Canada. A Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian.”
            That was Prime Minister Trudeau’s response to Trump’s latest racist tweet tirade where he told Democratic congresswomen of colour to “go back” to the countries they came from—disregarding the fact that all of them are American citizens and all but one were born in the United States.
            Trudeau’s remarks are almost easy to believe as a person of colour, if you’ve been lucky like me. I grew up in a multicultural community in north Toronto after immigrating at the age of three. I have always felt at ease here, where everywhere I go I can spot another South Asian and most days I’ll see a family on the subway that reminds me so much of mine when we first came to this country, likely navigating the difficulties that come with starting a new life, but never alone in their pursuit of making Canada their home.
            There was a specific moment that drove this home. I was in Oxford, England in the summer of 2016 shortly after Brexit had passed in the U.K. when a man on the street, a stranger, called me and my sister, who lives in the U.K., ‘foreigner c—ts.’ It was like I had been punched in the gut. Shaken, I couldn’t help but cry, an almost involuntary reaction, even though the altercation was over.<br /><br />
            The man had walked away after uttering what was essentially a more explicit way of saying ‘you don’t belong here’ (a common sentiment immediately post-Brexit). He was a stranger who meant nothing to me but I was so incredibly hurt. I was wrenched out of the safe and sheltered bubble my very multicultural upbringing had created around me and was reminded that the colour of my skin will always set me apart. Oh, so this is how it feels.
            I remember being struck by how this experience had happened to me on the very first day of my trip to the U.K. An impulsive part of me wished I could book a flight back to Canada right then and there. I felt homesick, afraid and betrayed. This wouldn’t happen to me back home, I thought. It never had. That’s not how it’s done in Canada, Trudeau said. I wish I could believe that wholeheartedly. But it doesn’t take very long to think of times I’ve witnessed the very opposite of how it’s supposedly ‘done in Canada.’
            For instance, I was walking in Kensington Market in Toronto several years ago with a friend, who was wearing a hijab when a man yelled at her to ‘go back where she came from, terrorist.’ We walked faster, not daring to look in his direction. I felt sick, the rest of that day tainted by the incident.<br /><br />
            More recently, I was in St. Catharines, Ont., earlier this year when I witnessed a man screaming at a Sikh man wearing a turban to ‘take that towel off his head.’ I crossed the street, hoping he didn’t turn his attention to another visible minority, my heart aching for the man who was just waiting for his bus to take him where he needed to go.
            I have only bore witness, but there are plenty of Canadians sharing their own experiences with being told to ‘go back to where they came from’ in the aftermath of Trump’s heinous comments and Trudeau’s tepid response.The incidents I’ve witnessed and experienced are purely anecdotal evidence. But it seems there could be a bigger shift taking place. According to a recent Ipsos poll done on behalf of Global News, 48% of Canadians agree that immigration is causing Canada to change in ways that they don’t like, while 44%
            agree that there are too many immigrants in Canada. Meanwhile, hate crimes are on the rise in the country, reaching an all-time high in 2017.<br /><br />
            No one in Canada has told me to go back to where I came from. But it feels like it’s just a matter of time. While I am a Canadian citizen, it feels like the only thing that sets me apart from the immigrants considered in this poll is that my parents did the right paperwork, passed a test and we said an oath. I can’t help but take the country’s rejection of immigrants personally.
            I suppose Trudeau’s response is partly true. The leader of our country isn’t the one funnelling racist filth onto Twitter and into the world, emboldening the bigots who were previously too afraid to speak their minds. But the internet knows no borders. To say a problem doesn’t exist in Canada, that we are somehow wholly better than what’s going on south of the border is naive and just plain wrong.`,

        title: `FYI, Boycotting Wayfair *Isn't* the Best Way to Help Migrants`,
        timeStamp: "11/03/2005",
        imageUrl: "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ieK5Vxje3ZA/maxresdefault.jpg",
        description: `Seriously, why can’t we have nice things? Online home store Wayfair has become the latest company to be called out for some no-good-very-bad-deeds. But this time, it started with the company’s own employees, who walked off the job on June 26 to protest Wayfair’s deal to provide government contractors with beds for the camps that house detained migrants at the United States border. Yeah, *those* camps.
            It didn’t have to be this way; employees requested the company cease involvement with these contractors, but Wayfair higher-ups responded with a resounding “NO.” So, employees planned a protest, and when the news broke, customers vowed to boycott the company in order to convey their displeasure and (hopefully) encourage Wayfair to reconsider.<br /><br />
            But here’s the thing. While we’re *all* for vive-ing la resistance, the sad truth is, boycotts don’t always lead to effective, long-term change. That’s not to say you should continue shopping at Wayfair; *not* purchasing that mid-century modern headboard will likely make you feel better and boycotts do raise public awareness. But that should be your first step, not your last—because there are tangible ways for Canadians to help migrants at the border.
            Whoever said shopping isn’t political is 100% wrong. As with many bad things in the world right now, the source of the Wayfair walkout leads back to Washington and the Trump administration. Since his election, President Trump has taken a strict stance on migrants fleeing across the Mexico/U.S. border, holding them in custody in detainment camps along the border until they can be sent back home and often working to criminally prosecute these migrants under the “zero-tolerance policy.”<br /><br />
            These detainments have largely, and horribly, affected children. According to a June 25 article by VOX, over the past several weeks, over 2,000 children have been held in custody without their parents, often for much longer than the legally outlined detainment period of 72 hours. Recently, government investigators have spoken out about the conditions in these camps, recounting babies in dirty diapers, sick children and overall unsafe conditions. There have been at least five reported deaths of migrant children within the camps.
            In a June 22 tweet, U.S. representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez referred to the detainment camps as “mass concentration camps.” So yeah, they’re horrible. But what does that have to do with your couch? A lot. Through a contract with BCFS Health and Human Services, a Texas not-for-profit organization, Wayfair reportedly sold $200,000 worth of bedroom furniture to furnish a detainment camp in Carrizo Springs, Texas. According to The Guardian, this camp houses up to 3,000 migrant children. In response to this news, Wayfair employees
             signed a petition asking that the company cease all business with these border camps and donate any profits made thus far to RAICES, a not-for-profit immigration legal service focusing on reuniting families and children separated at the border.`,
